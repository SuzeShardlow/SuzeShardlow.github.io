Remote kanbanning is tricky if you don't have money to spend on it, but we needed it for the Lean Coffee event we wanted to run.

Figuring out tooling for Lean Coffee was fun, especially as we have no budget.

I was going through the LoC Slack doing a bit of housekeeping when I found an old message from my friend and LoC colleague, Sarah, suggesting that we run a lean coffee session.  I asked if she still wanted to run one and she said yes.

I did a bit of reading and found out that:

* Lean Coffee sessions are structured but agendaless.
* Participants choose and vote on topics themselves, so it's entirely democratic and efficient.
* Usually, suggestions, voting and kanban is all done on post-its so we needed to find an online, shareable solution.


To run the lean coffee, you need to be able to:

* Have people type topics somewhere they can be seen and voted on - in person, this would be handwritten post-it notes on a wall.

* Place the topics in order of popularity - again, where they can be seen by all.  This is easy in person - just use post-its.

* Have a video conferencing system so people can discuss the topics.

* Time the rounds.


### Tooling

We looked at a number of tools.  Some of them had a free trial but, unfortunately, all of them were going to end up costing money and we have zero budget.

We decided on the following:

* Suggesting topics: Slack.  This meant names were automatically attached, everyone could see them.  Because of the admin burden, we stipulated that all attendees needed to contact us for Slack access by the day before the event.

* Voting for topics: Slack.  This is done on an honesty system.  We go through and put two different reaction emojis on each topic.  We give participants two votes each and they upvote by clicking on the emojis that are already there.

* Shareable kanban board: Trello.  We shared a view-only link on the basis that the voting could be done elsewhere and only the hosts needed to be able to update the board.

* Kitchen timer for the rounds, whichh we would just hold next to our mic.

### Topics

Here are some of the topics we discussed in our first two meetings:

*** I will probably cut the below as it's not really anything to do with it ***

Some of the queries I had were:

* What if people bring their own specific problems to discuss and try to monopolise the session?

Agenda items are voted for, so topics can only dominate if the majority agrees.  If you get to the end of the round and enough people want to move onto a new topic, that's that.

* What if some people dominate the chat?

This happens in normal meetings too and Lean Coffee isn't perfect, but you can always downvote a topic if you have heard enough from someone on the subject.

* There's a card there and I have no idea what it means.

Don't vote for it then.  Cards need to be self-explanatory otherwise valuable time is spent explaining what they're all about before anyone can start discussing them.  Also, after they've been explained, sometimes participants realise the topic is crap and they have nothing they want to say on the subject.
