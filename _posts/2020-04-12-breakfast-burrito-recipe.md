While visiting a Mexican takeaway in San Diego, I discovered the breakfast burrito: sausage, ham, cheese, egg and potato all steaming hot inside a tortilla.  As all of these components of a full English breakfast are readily available here in the UK, I decided to make my own version of this dish at home.

Here is my recipe.  I didn't skimp on prep time but there are definitely some convenience **shortcuts**, which I have included below.

### Preparation and cooking time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients

**Per burrito** (one burrito per person kept us full for hours):

* One sausage (or corresponding amount of sausage meat)
* Two rashers of streaky bacon (or ham - thick cut is probably best)
* Three eggs
* Handful of grated cheddar cheese
* Medium-sized potato, about the size of two eggs
* One soft tortilla wrap
* Dash of cooking oil

### Method

Preheat your oven to gas mark 7 / 425f / 220c / 200c (fan).

Peel and wash your potato.  Cut it in half across the width, then slice it into skinny chips.  You don't want them too fat or too long, otherwise they will take a long time to cook.

Put them in a baking tray / ovenproof dish and add a dash of cooking oil.  Make sure all the chips have a thin layer of oil on them.  Season according to your own taste (I like garlicy chips).

Cook them for 20 minutes in the oven.

While they are cooking, skin your sausages.  Divide the sausage meat into small pieces, about the size of peanut M&Ms.  At this point, I removed any obvious big pieces of fat from the sausage meat.

Cook the sausage pieces over a medium heat in a pan.  Don't be tempted to turn the heat up high, as you want the sausage to be cooked all the way through.

**Convenience shortcut:** Leave the sausages in their skins and cook them under the grill, then cut them into small pieces.

Whisk your eggs.  No need to add salt, as there is loads in the processed meats and cheese.  Scramble the eggs over a low to medium heat until they are almost cooked.

Fry the bacon rashers in the sausage or **convenience shortcut:** put them on the grill with the sausages.

Wrap the tortilla in foil and heat them in the oven per the instructions on the packet (mine said eight minutes).  **Convenience shortcut:** you can heat them for eight minutes in the microwave instead (don't use foil with this method).



`console.table()`, `console.group()` and `console.assert()` aren't as well-known as `console.log()`, but they are very useful for debugging.






## console.group()

We can organise console output by indenting it and making it collapsible.

For example, we want to check for products in stock every 10 seconds and print them out.

We also want to be able to easily see from the console output the time and date that the stock check was conducted.

The code here loops over the array every 10 seconds to check if each item is in stock.

So what does this look like in the console?
