Selling a house for the first time can be daunting.  It's totally different from the buying process, not least because you will likely employ an estate agent.

Like with any experience in the fun world of adulting, more preparation means fewer surprises.  Estate agents don't have the best image and I will let you make up your own mind about that.

What I will say is that any time you sign a contract, you're bound to it whether or not you understand what you're entering into.  It's pretty much a given that the terms of any contract are more favourable to the issuing party.  Therefore, it's not in that party's interests to educate you on what the contract means.

I get the impression that because people know about the general strategy for selling a house in that they need to get their house valued, advertise it and receive offers, they view the estate agency agreement as a simple piece of paper.  This isn't the case.

Aside from the contract, there's also the matter of estate agent fees, pricing your house and considering any offers.  The two main factors in most transactions are time and money.  Estate agents want quick sales.  If you do too, then great, your objectives are aligned.  However, most people want the best sale price they can get.  This is not top of the estate agent's list of priorities.

With all this in mind, here are some of the things I learnt when selecting an estate agent to sell through.

## Agent knowledge

Houses are marketed online these days, so from that point of view you can use anyone who puts all their properties on Rightmove and/or Zoopla.  However, it's a good idea to at least consult one that has recently sold similar houses in your area and can demonstrate this.  If they are selling all the houses in your area, then they are essentially setting the market rates.  Therefore, you'll get a realistic idea of how much you could get for yours by speaking to them.

## Valuation

Use the age-old method of getting three quotes and choosing the middle one.  Some agents I have dealt with are almost notorious for setting all their asking prices extremely high.  Get your valuations in and decide how much you can realistically get vs what you realistically want or need.

Take into account any (good or bad) differences between your place and the other places that have sold, how long everything stayed on the market and how long ago the agent's sales were.

Bear in mind that, unless you set your asking price low for a quick sale, you are going to have to do the offer negotiation dance later.  Therefore, usually, your valuation is one figure and your asking price is usually a figure maybe 10% higher than that to give you the wiggle room for the offer negotiation dance.

## Fees

Bricks and mortar estate agents (ie those with a physical sales office on the high street) generally charge a percentage of the final sale price.  In the past year I have seen anything from 0.7% to 1.2% plus VAT for sole agency.

You can negotiate the fee.  I always negotiate the fee.  I asked each agent what their fee was, then decided which agent I liked the most.  I then asked that agent to match the lowest fee.

The less you have to shell out, the more goes in your pocket, but bear in mind that if the agent is only getting a small percentage, then there is little incentive for them to strive to get a couple of extra grand out of your seller.

## Sole agency/muliple agency

You can either instruct one agency to market your property, or you can put it on with several agencies at the same time.  I have noticed that sellers tend to go with multiple agencies if they want a quick sale, or they have been trying to sell their house for a long time and haven't been able to agree a sale.

The fees for multiple agency are higher than for sole agency.
