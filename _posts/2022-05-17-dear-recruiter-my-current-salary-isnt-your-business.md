When you use my current salary as a basis for what I'm worth to you, you're being mean and lazy.  You're also actively perpetuating the gender and ethnicity pay gaps in tech.  What's worse is that you're a woman yourself.





It's a fact that people aren't paid equally for the same work





"I need to know if your salary expectations are aligned with what we can offer you."
But you haven't asked me what my salary expectations are.  You asked me what I'm currently paid.  What I expect to be paid in my next job may or may not have some connection with what I'm paid now.

If you want to know what my salary expectations are, then why not ask that question?  Or, better still, decide on an offer based on what you're looking for and how well I fit that?  Decide what you think I'm worth, instead of trying to find out what I think I'm worth or what my current employer thinks I'm worth.


"I need to know what people in this industry are being paid, so I can see how the market is doing and make sure we are paying market rate."
If you want to know the market rate, don't ask a woman.  And don't ask a brown person.  Basically, don't ask a brown woman because we are not in the upper percentile of earners.  There are lots of ways you can get data on market rates.


"It's on you to negotiate."
Yes, it is.  Your job is to negotiate, so you know a lot of strategies.  A common one is anchoring, where you table your preferred option (your offer or salary range) as a variation on what's already been put forward (my current salary).


- All jobs, job titles, companies etc are different
- I work in devrel.  Everyone's background and skills are different so you can't easily compare us
- You asked me this question in our first meeting so you are making the decision about pay right at the beginning before I have met anyone at the actual company
- Are you passing this information to the company or is it just for your own reference?
- The company must have told you what their budget is.  As a professional, you should be able to determine whether I am within that range or if you think I am too low or too high
- It seems to be a British thing - all the recruiters asked me when I was in my 20s.  In my conversations with American recruiters, nobody has asked me this question
- I know what the market rate is as well as you do
- You know I can't lie about it, because my salary is on my P46.  I feel comfortable declining to answer the question, but a lot of people aren't.  I wasn't comfortable when I was younger
- By casually asking this question along with other admin-type stuff (like "how long is your notice period?") you are couching this as something mundane and integral to the recruitment process
- Not knowing my salary doesn't stop you from making me an offer




This week's big news is that the UK has entered recession for the first time since 2009.  It's the worst downturn since quarterly records began.  But what even is a recession and how do they happen?

A **recession** is when the **economy** of a country is **temporarily performing badly**.  This means that the economy is experiencing negative economic growth, or **contracting**.

Imagine a **balloon**.  You blow air into it, it expands like a **growing economy**.  You let some air out, it gets smaller like a **contracting economy**.

In the UK, the decline in performance needs to last for **two consecutive quarters** (ie **six months**, in this case January to March (**Q1**) and April to June (**Q2**) of **2020**) for it to be classed as a recession.

Therefore, with **COVID-19** and **Brexit** forcing the temporary or permanent closure of thousands of businesses, it's **not surprising** that we now have a UK recession.

## How is "performance" measured?

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

A country's economic performance is measured in terms of GDP: Gross Domestic Product, usually per quarter.  Therefore, **GDP growth = economic growth**.  There are **three ways** of calculating this for any given time period:

* total **income** earned by companies and individuals
* total **expenditure** (by households, businesses and the Government)
* total value of **output** ie the value added to the economy in terms of the market prices of all finished goods and services produced by the country
