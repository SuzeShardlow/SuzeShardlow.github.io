The main reason you want to know what I'm paid now is so you can take this figure, add a few grand onto it and present that as an improvement on my current deal that I should be grateful to accept.  I'm not allowing you to do this.




This week's big news is that the UK has entered recession for the first time since 2009.  It's the worst downturn since quarterly records began.  But what even is a recession and how do they happen?

A **recession** is when the **economy** of a country is **temporarily performing badly**.  This means that the economy is experiencing negative economic growth, or **contracting**.

Imagine a **balloon**.  You blow air into it, it expands like a **growing economy**.  You let some air out, it gets smaller like a **contracting economy**.

In the UK, the decline in performance needs to last for **two consecutive quarters** (ie **six months**, in this case January to March (**Q1**) and April to June (**Q2**) of **2020**) for it to be classed as a recession.

Therefore, with **COVID-19** and **Brexit** forcing the temporary or permanent closure of thousands of businesses, it's **not surprising** that we now have a UK recession.

## How is "performance" measured?

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

A country's economic performance is measured in terms of GDP: Gross Domestic Product, usually per quarter.  Therefore, **GDP growth = economic growth**.  There are **three ways** of calculating this for any given time period:

* total **income** earned by companies and individuals
* total **expenditure** (by households, businesses and the Government)
* total value of **output** ie the value added to the economy in terms of the market prices of all finished goods and services produced by the country
