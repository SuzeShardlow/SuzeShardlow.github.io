While visiting a taqueria in San Diego, I discovered the breakfast burrito: sausage, ham, cheese, egg and potato all steaming hot inside a tortilla.  As all the components of a full English breakfast are readily available here in the UK, I decided to make my own version of this dish at home.

Here is my recipe.  I didn't skimp on prep time but there are definitely some convenience **shortcuts**, which I have included within the method.

### Preparation and cooking time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients

**Per burrito** (one burrito per person kept us full for hours):

* One **sausage** (or corresponding amount of sausage meat)
* Two rashers of **streaky bacon** (or ham - thick cut is probably best)
* Three **eggs**
* Handful of grated **mild cheddar cheese**
* Medium-sized **potato**, about the size of two eggs
* One soft **tortilla wrap**
* Dash of cooking **oil**

### Method

Preheat your oven to **gas mark 7** / 425f / 220c / 200c (fan).

Peel and wash your **potato**.

Cut it in half across the width, then slice it into short, skinny **chips** (eg 3cm * 0.7cm * 0.7cm).  You don't want them too fat or too long, otherwise they will take a long time to cook and you'll have a lumpy burrito.

Put them in a baking tray / ovenproof dish and add a dash of cooking **oil**.  Make sure all the chips have a thin layer of oil on them.  Season according to your own taste (I like **garlicy chips**).

Cook them for **20 minutes** in the oven.

While they are cooking, skin your **sausages**.  Divide the sausage meat into **small pieces**, about the size of **peanut M&Ms**.  At this point, I removed any obvious big pieces of fat from the sausage meat.  Yes, I know this fat is present when I cook the sausages whole, but when you can see it, it's different...

Cook the sausage pieces over a **medium heat** in a pan.  Don't be tempted to turn the heat up high, as you want the sausage to be cooked all the way through.

***Convenience shortcut:*** Leave the sausages in their skins and cook them under the **grill**, then cut them into small pieces.

Whisk your **eggs**.  No need to add salt, as there is loads in the processed meats and cheese.  **Scramble** the eggs over a **low to medium heat** until they are almost cooked.

Fry the **bacon** rashers in the sausage pan or ***convenience shortcut:*** put them on the grill with the sausages.

Cut the **bacon** rashers into bite-sized pieces.

Wrap the **tortilla** in foil (I laid them out flat) and heat them in the oven per the instructions on the packet (mine said eight minutes).  ***Convenience shortcut:*** you can heat them for eight seconds in the microwave instead (don't use foil with this method).

Grate the **cheese**.

A minute or two before the **chips** are cooked and the **tortilla** are warmed, add the **sausages**, **bacon** and **cheese** to the **eggs** in the pan and turn the heat back on.  Finish scrambling the **eggs**.  The **cheese** should melt by the time the eggs are cooked.

Remove the **chips** and **tortilla** from the oven.  Blot excess **oil** from the **chips** if necessary.

Transfer the **egg mixture** from the pan to the **tortilla**.

Add the **chips** to the mixture, distributing evenly.

Tuck both ends of the **tortilla** in and roll your **burrito**.

**Enjoy!**

### What I'll do differently next time

* I didn't get much of a stretch on the **cheese**, and I love **stretchy cheese**, so next time instead of adding it to the pan, I will spread a layer of it over the **tortilla** so it encases the mixture and is not cooked into it.

* I will probably heat the **tortilla** in the microwave because it's much quicker and will therefore help me manage my time better.
