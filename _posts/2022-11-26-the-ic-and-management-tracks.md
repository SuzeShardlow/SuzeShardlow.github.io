There are generally two tracks:

Individual contributor (IC)
Management

The levels / job titles within these (eg Software Engineer I, II etc) vary between companies.

If you don’t have anyone reporting to you, you’re an IC. IC levels can go from entry level to very senior.

If the IC is very junior then they are focused on doing. If they’re very senior they’re also focused on doing, but at a higher level.  The very senior will also take on leadership activities like coaching others in the team and strategising. With the seniority comes a lot more autonomy.

On the management track, there are also different levels of seniority. As it’s a managerial role, it doesn’t start at entry level like IC does. You’ll be strategising, but also managing, ie making sure the work gets done. You’ll be leading, so you’ll be responsible for your team’s health and looking at things like career paths, resourcing etc. You might be doing some hands-on stuff, but it will be much less than if you were an IC. You often hear people describing it as being “further away from the code”.

In both roles you could be doing the following types of activity:

Managing budget
Working as part of a project team
Coaching / teaching

As an IC you might have managerial-looking words in your job title, eg Manager or Director or Chief <something> Officer. Eg I’m an IC and I’m Developer Community Manager but I don’t manage anyone. I manage the community. I’ve noticed on the management side, they’re often styled as “Manager, <function>” which feels a bit clumsy but looks like it’s one way that some companies distinguish between the tracks.
