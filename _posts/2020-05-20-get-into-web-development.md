I've been looking at ways to innovate our [Ladies Of Code (LoC) London](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK) offerings now that COVID-19 has forced us 100% online, which led to me devising an interview format for our *Get Into...* series.

*Get Into...* is where we **demystify roles** in the tech industry.  Our first event was [Get Into... Gaming and AI](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/269878055/), which was a **traditional talk with slides** and was very popular.  We're currently in **lockdown** and, while we used to plan **one in-person meetup per month**, we've been producing **at least two every week** since the beginning of April.

I'm not sure whether this is because:

* Time in lockdown is going **100 times slower than normal time** so monthly just seems like too long, or
* We LoC organisers have to pay for our community's **Zoom subscription** out of our own pockets, so we want to get the **most value** out of it, or
* Not having a physical venue, host, catering etc means the **lead time** for setting up an event is **WAY shorter**.

Either way, we've been keen to keep up the momentum and **support our community** with opportunities to **get together** and **learn stuff**.

LoC events cater for those who are **already in tech** and want to **level up** and/or **switch tracks** as well as those who are **new to the industry**.  People are always keen to hear from those who have **gone before them**.  So we had a think about some of the roles people are most curious about.  I am a **web developer**, so I took an action to find someone who could talk about how they got into web development.

## Before the event

### Sourcing a speaker/format selection

#### Person and role

I **knew exactly whom I wanted** to interview.  I had met [Niamh McCooey](https://twitter.com/niamhmccoo) at an event last year and she was at [GDCFP Day]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-03-25-so-you-want-to-speak-at-a-tech-conference.md %}) too.  Later in 2019, as experienced speakers, we gave talks at the [same tech meetup](https://codebar.io/meetings/monthly-oct-2019).

Niamh's story is a bit different because she **taught herself**.  I wanted to highlight this as a **viable route to paid coding work** which may be an option for those who can't access bootcamps or similar courses.

#### Format selection

I know talks take **weeks to write**.  I wanted to **reduce the labour** on Niamh as well as minimise the **lead time**.  I hit upon the **idea** of using a **chat show-style interview** format instead of asking Niamh to write a new talk.

**Advantages to the speaker:**

* **There's very little labour.**  Niamh fed back that it was **great** that she had to do **zero prep** and could **just turn up**.
* They don't have to think about **timekeeping** - they can rely on me for that.
* The speaker doesn't have to worry about whether what they're going to say will cover all the desired **topics**, which might be the case if they had to write a talk.
* It's more **fun** to sit and have a chat than it is to give a presentation.
* They get **instant verbal feedback**, which doesn't happen whan you give a talk - especially online - unless you ask the audience to jump in with questions while you're speaking.
* The sessions are **recorded** and uploaded to YouTube, so they can point to these as examples of **public speaking**.

**Advantages to me:**

* I have more control over **aligning the content with the desired event outcomes**.
* We can have a **longer session**: a long talk is usually about 30 minutes plus Q&A whereas this would be **nearly an hour** of Q&A and discussion.
* I can manage the **timekeeping** on the night and ensure adherence to the schedule.
* It's a bit **different** from the other tech meetup webinars, so potentially **more engaging**.

**Disadvantages to me:**

* **All the labour is on me.**  When you use this format, you (should) have a set of pre-written **questions**.  You also need to be a good **multitasker**.  This involves listening to the **answers** while deciding what you want to **ask next**, identifying which **threads** you'll pick up and develop, determining how you'll weave the **live Q&A** in and establishing when's a good time to stop.  However, it's worth it for the results.
* I already knew Niamh, so this wasn't an issue, but if you are going to approach someone **you don't know** too well/have never heard speak, you don't know how **forthcoming** they will be/how much **probing** you will need to do to get the **information** you need.

### Creating a YouTube channel

I wanted the interview series to have some **longevity** and be **available** for those who couldn't watch it live, so I created LoC's first [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF-o7cvylZZjRkoZhe1T5zw/videos).

### Branding and promotion

The name of this series was ***Get Into...*** (we also have our project **co-working** series [***Get On With It***]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-05-10-get-on-with-it.md %}) and [***Get Coffee***](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/270677983/), our [**lean coffee**](https://leancoffee.org/) series).  I created an eyecatching *Get Into...* **brand** and promotional **banner** (the one at the top of this page) to use on **meetup.com** and across **social networks** (including **YouTube**).  I designed it so it was **easily adaptable** for other events in the series while retaining the **same look and feel**.

### Questions

On the day, I had a set of questions I had prepared **beforehand**, along with some which had been suggested by **attendees**.  I decided to weave the latter into the interview, as opposed to ask them in a big unordered chunk at the end of the discussion.

#### Host questions

As mentioned earlier, the **interview format** works perfectly for getting guests onboard and in the hot seat **quickly**, because they immediately recognise that they have **very little work** to do beyond giving up a couple of hours of their time to talk to you.

I chose my questions carefully and put a lot of thought into how to **structure** the interview.  I didn't purely want to go through a **chronological** description of how Niamh changed careers.  Therefore I arranged the questions into three themes:

* **Discovering** and **learning**
* Getting **confident**; getting **paid** to do coding
* Continuous learning and **what's next** in the career journey

I also came up with the idea of doing two **speed rounds**.  This was partly because I knew Niamh and knew she would be a good sport, but also to **break the interview up**.  It's hard for the audience to stay focused when they've been staring at a screen all day so I wanted to change up the **pace** and **tone**.  Here are the clips:

#### Audience questions

We invited attendees to suggest questions either when **signing up** for the event, or in the **Zoom chat** function during the interview.  Some of the questions were **similar** to each other or to questions already on my list, so I didn't ask all of them verbatim.

## During the event

We always make sure we have one person whose job it is to be the Zoom host, so they can manage any **code of conduct** violations etc.  Therefore my only role at this event was to interview Niamh.  Like I said earlier, this required a lot of focus and flexibility as audience questions were being sent to me which I had to assess quickly while still listening to what Niamh was saying and formulating my next response.

## After the event

I'm not an expert in **video editing** but I wanted to make it look less plain than a basic Zoom recording.  Therefore I **post-produced** the video, by:

* Chopping the **excess recording** from before and after the actual interview material. 
* Adding the LoC *Get Into...*-**branded banner** to the video.
* Pulling the two **speed rounds** out to share as "taster videos" on [social media](https://twitter.com/SuzeShardlow/status/1257240046916243456?s=20).

I created a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF-o7cvylZZjRkoZhe1T5zw) for LoC and uploaded the video.

I then promoted the video across [social media](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-6662739656297205760-zZgl).
