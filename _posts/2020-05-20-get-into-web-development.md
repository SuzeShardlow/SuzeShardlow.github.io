I've been looking at ways to innovate our Ladies Of Code (LoC) offerings now we're 100% online, which led me to introducing an interview format for our Get Into... series.

Get Into... is our series which aims to demystify roles in the tech industry.  Our first event was [Get Into Gaming and AI](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/events/269878055/), which was a traditional talk.  We're currently in lockdown and, while we used to deliver one in-person meetup per month, we've been producing at least two every week since the beginning of April.

I'm not sure whether this is because:

* Time in lockdown is going 100 times slower than normal time so monthly just seems like too long, or
* We three LoC organisers have to pay for our community's Zoom subscription out of our own pockets, so we want to get the most value out of it, or
* Not having a physical venue, host, catering etc means the lead time for setting up an event is WAY shorter.

Either way, we've been keen to keep up the momentum and support our community with opportunities to get together and learn stuff.

LoC events cater for those who are already in tech and want to level up and/or switch tracks as well as those who are new to the industry.  People are always keen to hear from those who have gone before them.  So we had a think about some of the roles people are most curious about.  I am a web developer, so I took an action to find a web developer who could talk about how they got into web development.

## Before the event

### Sourcing a speaker/format selection

I knew exactly who I wanted to speak to.  I had met Niamh McCooey at a meetup last year: she'd attended GDCFP Day with me and we had spoken at the same meetup later in the year.  Niamh's story is a bit different because she taught herself and I wanted to highlight this as a viable route which may be available to those who can't access bootcamps or similar courses.

As I mentioned before, we have been churning out the events.  Therefore, I figured it made sense to do as much as possible in my power to reduce the lead time.  I knew Niamh already had some talks, as I had heard them.  They were very good but were not exclusively about how she became a web developer, how she got her first job and all that other stuff people want to know about.

I know talks take weeks to write.  I wanted to reduce the labour on Niamh as well as minimise the lead time.  I hit upon the idea of using a chat show-style interview format instead of asking Niamh to write a new talk.

Advantages:

* All the labour is on me.  Niamh commented afterwards that it was great that she had to do zero prep and could just turn up.
* I can make sure the content is aligned to the event outcomes we want (that people leave the event more informed about how to get into web development).
* We can have a longer session - a long talk is usually about 30 minutes plus Q&A whereas this would be nearly an hour of Q&A and discussion.
* It's a bit different from the other webinars you see, so potentially more engaging.
* Niamh commented afterwards that it was fun.  I definitely had more fun than if I were purely listening for half an hour.

Disadvantages:

* All the labour is on me (LOL).  You have a set of pre-written questions but need to be listening to the answers and deciding what you want to ask next, what threads you'll pick up and develop, how you'll weave the live Q&A in.  However, it's worth it for the results.
* I had never done this before, so I was fretting about whether I had enough questions.  In the end, I had more than enough.
* I already knew Niamh, so this wasn't an issue, but if you are going to approach someone you don't know too well/have never heard speak, you don't know how forthcoming they will be/how easy it will be to get the information you need via questioning.

### Branding and promotion

The name of this series was Get Into (we also have our project co-working series Get On With It and Get Coffee, our lean coffee series).  I created an eyecatching Get Into... brand and promotional banner to use on meetup.com and across social networks (including YouTube).  I designed it so it was easily adaptable for other sessions in the series while retaining the same look and feel.

### Questions

As mentioned earlier, the interview format works perfectly for getting guests in quickly and getting them to agree, because they quickly see that they have very little work to do beyond giving up a couple of hours of their time to talk to you.

I chose my questions carefully and put a lot of thought into how to structure the interview.  I didn't purely want to go through a chronological description of how Niamh changed careers.  Therefore I arranged the questions into three themes:

* Need to look these up lol
* 
* 

I also came up with the idea of doing two quick-fire rounds.  This was partly because I knew Niamh and knew she would be a good sport, but also to break the interview up.  It's hard to stay focused when you've been staring at a screen all day so I wanted to change up the pace and tone.  Here are the quick-fire clips:

## During the event

We always make sure we have one person whose job it is to be the Zoom host, so they can manage any trolling issues etc.  Therefore my only role at this event was to interview Niamh.  Like I said earlier, this required a lot of focus and flexibility as audience questions were being sent to me which I had to assess quickly while still listening to what Niamh was saying and formulating my next response.

## After the event

I post-produced the video, by:

* Chopping the excess recording from before and after the actual interview material. 
* Adding the LoC Get Into...-branded banner to the video.
* Pulling the two quick-fire rounds out 

I created a YouTube channel for LoC and uploaded the video.

I then promoted the video across social media.
