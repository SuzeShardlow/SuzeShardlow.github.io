I did my first tech talk as a software engineer back in April, about how I switched careers.  The Chief Creative Officer at a TV company saw the video and contacted me to ask if I would guest on her podcast!

She was interviewing women in creative roles and counted coding as one of them.  I accepted the invitation straightaway and, a few weeks later, went to record the podcast with her.

We talked coding, crafting and creativity: what I love about them and how they're all linked.

### This is the result: Renee Vaughan Sutherland interviewing me for the Greater Than 11% podcast.
