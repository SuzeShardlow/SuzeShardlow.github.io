The winners on the 2020 Women In Software Power List have been announced and I'm one of them!

I am excited and surprised to have been nominated for this award.  This year's theme is ***Changing The Narrative*** and I was selected for my work in the **tech community**, as well as **tech education**.

This year, I have been **teaching coding** to Professors and PhDs at the **University of Sussex**.  Through this workshop series, I have built a **chatbot** which allows you to talk to a dataset containing **archived interviews** with young women, taped 30 years ago at the height of the **AIDS epidemic**.

Read more about this on my **[/public_speaking](public speaking page)** and at the [project's blog](http://reanimatingdata.co.uk/uncategorized/a-feminist-chat-bot/).

The judges also recognised my work in the **tech community**: I am Chapter Lead at **[Ladies of Code London](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/)** and Director at **[Women Who Code London](https://www.womenwhocode.com/london/about)**.

I joined those organisations in **2013** and **2014** respectively.  Traditionally, we've met in person but COVID-19 has changed the world and we have taken everything online.

I am particularly proud of the fact that, at **Ladies of Code London**, we've delivered nearly **40 online events** - many of which I have hosted - since the UK entered lockdown in **April 2020**.  We went digital, and fast.  This meant **rapid innovation** and we launched four digital series:

* **Get On With It**: co-working productivity sessions for folks needing help with motivation.  This series has been picked up by groups in the USA who are borrowing our ideas with proper attribution.
* **Get Into...**: talks and interviews featuring people in all kinds of tech roles who demystify their discipline for us and describe how we can get there too.
* **Get Coffee**: a Lean Coffee series we facilitate using free tools on the web.  Some are freeform and some have been follow-ons from Get Into interviews for a deeper dive.
* **Get Heard**: a set of workshops, inspired by Global Diversity CFP Day, to help people find a tech talk topic, then create and deliver that talk in front of a live audience.
