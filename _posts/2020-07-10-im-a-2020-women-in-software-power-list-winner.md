The winners on the 2020 Women In Software Power List have been announced and I'm one of them!

I am excited and surprised to have been nominated for this award.  This year's theme is ***Changing The Narrative*** and I was selected for my work in the **tech community**, as well as **tech education**.

## Teaching

This year, I have been **teaching coding** to Professors and PhDs at the **University of Sussex**.  Through this workshop series, I have built a **chatbot** which allows you to talk to a dataset containing **archived interviews** with young women, taped 30 years ago at the height of the **AIDS epidemic**.

Read more about this on my **[public speaking page](/public_speaking)** and at the **[project's blog](http://reanimatingdata.co.uk/uncategorized/a-feminist-chat-bot/)**.

## Community Management

The judges also recognised my work in the **tech community**: I am Chapter Lead at **[Ladies of Code London](https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-UK/)** (3700 members) and Director at **[Women Who Code London](https://www.womenwhocode.com/london/about)** (6400 members).

I **joined** those organisations in **2013** and **2014** respectively.  Traditionally, we've met in person but COVID-19 has changed the world and we have taken everything online.

### Ladies of Code London

I am particularly proud of the fact that, at **Ladies of Code London**, since the UK entered lockdown in **April 2020**, we've delivered nearly **40 online events** - many of which I have presented solo.  We went digital, and fast.  This meant **rapid innovation** and we launched four digital series which have attracted new members from around the world, increasing our membership by **10%**:

* **Get On With It**: **co-working productivity** sessions for folks needing help with **motivation**.  This series has been picked up by groups in the **USA** who are borrowing our ideas with proper **attribution**.  [I've blogged about our methodology.](/blog/2020/05/10/get-on-with-it/)
* **Get Into...**: talks and interviews featuring people in all kinds of tech roles who demystify their discipline for us and describe how we can get there too.  Find out [how we did it](/blog/2020/06/05/get-into-web-development/) and [watch the videos](https://suze.dev/youtube).
* **Get Coffee**: a **Lean Coffee** series we facilitate using **free tools** on the web.  Some are freeform and some have been follow-ons from **Get Into** interviews for a **deeper dive**.  [I've blogged about how we ran Lean Coffee sessions on zero budget.](/blog/2020/05/29/online-lean-coffee-on-zero-budget/)
* **Get Heard**: a set of workshops, inspired by **Global Diversity CFP Day** (GDCFP Day), to help people find a **tech talk** topic, then create and deliver that talk in front of a **live audience**.  [Read about my GDCFP Day learnings.](/blog/2019/03/25/so-you-want-to-speak-at-a-tech-conference/)

### Women Who Code (WWCode) London

I'm now in my second year of **leading WWCode London** which is a completely different experience: it's a **global** organisation with 80 chapters worldwide.  We [relaunched the London chapter last summer](https://www.womenwhocode.com/blog/women-who-code-london-announces-new-leadership-of-wwcode-london) and, since then, have passed the 6000 member mark.

Last year, I was lucky enough to be selected to **speak at their conference** in Berlin.

Being on **holiday doesn't stop me** from doing the community thing.  In January when I was in California, I designed and delivered a **workshop** for **WWCode San Diego**.  This was a **hands-on** session, teaching people how to build their own **personal dev portfolio and blogging website**: something lots of people think about in the new year.

### Get In Touch!

I'm always **happy to chat** about any of the above!  Get in touch if you'd like me to **organise something for you** or you'd like to **give a talk** at one of my events.
