The threat of COVID-19 meant we had to take Ladies Of Code (LoC) London events online or not meet at all.  I had heard of Zoombombing and wanted to reduce the risk to our members.

Friends of mine told how they had attended other online meetups on Zoom, only to have the screen share hijacked by a troll displaying graphic hardcore porn.

It's important to note that Zoom is not the only platform that these people target.  We considered a range of different ways to take our meetups online.  (That's a whole other blog post.)  Zoom is the go-to app for thousands of communities because it has many great features.  Its rapid rise in popularity, combined with the fact countless users aren't changing the default settings, has meant that it's the go-to app for many trolls too.
