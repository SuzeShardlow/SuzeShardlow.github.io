The threat of COVID-19 meant we had to take Ladies Of Code (LoC) London events online or not meet at all.  I had heard of Zoombombing and wanted to reduce the risk to our members.

Friends of mine told how they had attended other online meetups on Zoom, only to have the screen share hijacked by a troll displaying graphic hardcore porn.

It's important to note that Zoom is not the only platform that these people target.  We considered a range of different ways to take our meetups online.  (That's a whole other blog post.)  Zoom is the go-to app for thousands of communities because it has many great features.  Its rapid rise in popularity, combined with the fact countless users aren't changing the default settings, has meant that it's the go-to app for many trolls too.

Therefore, before we ran our first event, I did some research into how Zoombombing happens and what you can do to prevent it.

The below is by no means a method of making your event like Fort Knox, but will make you less of an easy target.

## Allocate tasks

When we first signed up for Zoom, we were only allowed one host and no co-hosts.  This has recently changed, so you can now give hosting permissions to other people on the call.

However, if you want to run a nice slick event, it's good practice to identify and agree tasks beforehand anyway.

At LoC we ensure that there are two organisers on every call, both with hosting capabilities.  One of the organisers is in charge of watching out for any trouble and dealing with it accordingly.  The other organiser is the "face" of the event.  They open and close the meetup.  They have hosting permissions so can step in and deal with trouble if needed, but they rely on their colleague to make sure everything is running smoothly in the background to ensure a seamless experience for the attendees.

## Limit the capacity of your meeting

We decided that 40 was a reasonable number of people for the host to feasibly keep an eye on.  Knowing that we get a 50% attendance rate, whether online or in-person, we cap signups at 80 for our webinars.

## Log into zoom.us on your computer and tweak your default settings

###  Enable the waiting room

I think this is standard now, but it wasn't when we signed up for Zoom.

Enabling the waiting room means you can vet people before you let them into the live call.

#### You might not know the names of all your members.

On meetup.com, people tend to use pseudonyms, initials, first names only etc.  Therefore, seeing names in the waiting room may not help you if you are running


### Mute all participants on entry



### Allow participants to unmute themselves



### Lock the call
