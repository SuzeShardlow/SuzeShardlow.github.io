I've been recognised for my community building, event hosting and tech education work.  There were a total of 700 nominations and I am in the top 100!  Here's what they said about me...

"Suze creates and delivers her own coding courses, teaching Python and JavaScript as well as how to create your own personal branding website.  She has worked with academics at the University of Sussex to bring their research interviews from 30 years ago to life via a chatbot.  The interviews are with women about their views on love, sex and relationships at the height of the AIDS pandemic.  Suze is also a technical writer and conference speaker, having given talks in the UK and overseas.  She’s an experienced and engaging event host who instinctively gets the best out of her guests and speakers, even when live and unedited.

"During the COVID-19 pandemic, Suze took all her tech meetups online, delivering more than 120 hours of live online tech content across 50+ events.  These included over 90 hours of facilitated tech co-working sessions which helped more than 60 people through lockdown.  She designed and delivered more than 15 hours of public speaking coaching and mentoring workshops, then organised and hosted a live online showcase event for the women (all software engineers) who “graduated” from these workshops.  Suze’s tech community event ideas and methodologies, borne of two decades of knowing her various audiences and documented in her blog, have been replicated by other groups including those based in Silicon Valley, California."
