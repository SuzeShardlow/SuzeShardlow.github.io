GitHub has recently rolled out a new feature which allows you to add a README to your GitHub profile.  Here's how to get yours in two steps.

## 1) Create a new repo with the same name as your GitHub username.

Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and type your **GitHub username** into the **Repository name** field.

Make sure you leave it as a **Public** repo and **initialise it with a README**.

When you press the **Create repository** button, the README will be **live immediately** with some **default content**.

## 2) Customise and edit your README.

You can do this on the **GitHub website** or **clone the repo** to your computer and do it locally.

Add whatever **text**, **pictures** etc you like.  GitHub gives you some suggestions to get started.

If you want to use an **image** that's in one of your other **public repos**, link to it in the usual way:

Use the **[usual markdown formatting](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)** for your text.

That's it!
