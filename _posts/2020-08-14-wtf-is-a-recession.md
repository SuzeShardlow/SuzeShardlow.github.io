This week's big news is that the UK has entered recession for the first time since 2009.  But what even is a recession and how do they happen?

A recession is when the economy of a country is temporarily performing badly.  This means that the economy is experiencing negative economic growth, or contracting.

Imagine a balloon.  You blow air into it, it expands like a growing economy.  You let some air out, it gets smaller like a contracting economy.

In the UK, the decline in performance needs to last for two consecutive quarters (ie six months, in this case January to March (Q1) and April to June (Q2) of 2020) for it to be classed as a recession.

Therefore, with COVID-19 and Brexit forcing the temporary or permanent closure of thousands of businesses, it's not surprising that we now have a UK recession.

## How is "performance" measured?

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

A country's economic performance is measured in terms of GDP: Gross Domestic Product, usually per quarter.  Therefore, GDP growth = economic growth.  There are three ways of calculating this for any given time period:

* total income earned by companies and individuals
* total expenditure (by households, businesses and the Government)
* total value of output ie the value added to the economy in terms of the market prices of all finished goods and services produced by the country

All these methods should, theoretically, give you the same result.

The [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)](https://data.oecd.org/gdp/gross-domestic-product-gdp.htm) defines GDP as "the standard measure of the value added created through the production of goods and services in a country during a certain period".

### Calculating changes in GDP

If GDP growth = economic growth, we need some way of looking at the change over time so we can determine whether the economy has grown or contracted.

However, we can't do this just by doing a straight comparison of the real data.  This is because £100 buys you a different amount of goods now than it did in the past.  Your purchasing power is affected by inflation (or deflation), so this needs to be taken into account when comparing GDP for different time periods.

Once the GDP at current prices has been calculated and adjusted for inflation/deflation, it can more accurately be compared against previous GDP figures.

### Comparing GDP internationally

To more fairly compare GDP between nations of different sizes, we express a country's GDP divided by its resident citizens (ie not including those located overseas), to give a GDP per capita (ie per head).

The latest OECD figures show that Luxembourg has the highest GDP per capita in the world, followed by Singapore and Ireland.

We can then adjust these figures to take into account purchasing power.  This is because, for example, €100 in Spain will buy you a different amount of the same items from €100 in Italy, even though the two countries use the same currency.

## What affects economic performance?

Factors that affect GDP are:

### Manufacturing production

If production drops, the amount of goods and services that can be sold drops accordingly, reducing revenue and tax income.  Jobs may have to be cut, thereby increasing unemployment and reducing household spending and tax revenue (VAT and income tax).

### Levels of investment

High levels of investment in, for example, equipment means that money is flowing through the economy in the form of sales transactions, employee wages and sales and income tax.  It also means the companies who are making the equipment are manufacturing more.

### The rate of unemployment

Low unemployment means more households with an income, which leads to more spending.  In fact, if you're using the total expenditure method of calculating GDP, household spending accounts for the majority.  More spending means more sales tax flowing to the Government and more revenue for businesses, some of which they will reinvest.

## How can we avoid recession?

You can't, really.  Economies naturally go through cycles of prosperity and downturn.  Therefore, recession is a fact of life: what goes up must come down.

Various events can trigger damage to the economy, like the current coronavirus crisis or the credit crunch of 2008 which have both led to economic slumps all over the world.

Ironically, worrying about a downturn can invoke one.  If people are anxious about losing their jobs, they may spend less and save more.  This results in less money flowing to businesses and the Government via tax.  If businesses lose income then they will have less money to spend on production, so they may have to cut jobs etc.

## Is any segment of the economy recession-proof?

People change their spending habits at all stages of the economic cycle and, for obvious reasons, tighten their belts during a recession.

How well a particular industry does during a recession depends, to some extent, on what caused the recession.  For example, when unemployment is high, people may still choose to go on holiday, but instead of travelling overseas they might take a cheaper holiday in the UK.  However, the current economic problems have partly been caused by COVID which, for a long period, removed our ability to leave the house except to obtain essential items or for short periods of exercise.  This has meant that even the UK holiday destinations have taken a massive hit.

People cut back their spending in various ways.  They can stop buying things completely (eg decide not to upgrade electronics) or they can buy fewer things (eg clothes).  They can also modify their spending habits.  For example, people can't live without food and there is only so far they can go with cutting their supermarket spending.  However, if they are accustomed to eating out and they don't want to cook all the time, they might stop eating in restaurants and switch to the cheaper option of buying takeaways instead.

This is why fast food outlets often experience an increase in business during a recession.  The COVID situation also saw many people buying more takeaways in a bid to help ensure local, independent businesses survived the pandemic.

## What is a depression, as opposed to a recession?

- a depression is a recession that lasts ages (cite The Great Depression in the USA and its causes and also mention when the last one in the UK was)

## What does recession mean for you?

- lack of jobs
- not being able to save
- higher prices in the shops

## Should you be worried?

Any time there is bad news about the economy, it's always worrying.

Some questions that you might want to answer in the recession post love, just some ideas:



* Are there any bargains to be had during a recession? (e.g. will more people who can invest in property, stocks that dip lower, buy cars cheaper or on cheap finance?)
* What tools does the government have to help hasten the end of a recession? (spending on infrastructure projects, VAT reductions or similar to spur consumer spending?)

Maybe also consider something like...

* If I'm moving house during a recession should I consider staying put if my house is losing value?  - like trading a car in for a newer one, it's not really the value of the old car or the price of the new one that matters, but the cost to change from one to another.  If this stays about the same in a recession then you're no worse off - but of course you may have less job security / other costs go higher or income lower ?
