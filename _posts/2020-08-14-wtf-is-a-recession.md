This week's big news is that the UK has entered recession for the first time since 2009.  But what even is a recession and how do they happen?

A recession is when the economy of a country is temporarily performing badly.

This means that the economy is experiencing negative economic growth, or contracting.

Imagine a balloon.  You blow air into it, it expands like a growing economy.  You let some air out, it gets smaller like a contracting economy.

In the UK, the decline in performance needs to last for two consecutive quarters (ie six months, in this case January to March (Q1) and April to June (Q2) of 2020) for it to be classed as a recession.

Therefore, with COVID-19 forcing the temporary or permanent closure of thousands of businesses, it's not surprising that we now have a UK recession.

## How is "performance" measured?

### Benchmarking

- include some info here about how the benchmark is calculated

### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

A country's economic performance is measured in terms of GDP: Gross Domestic Product.  There are three ways of calculating this.  I won't describe them all here, but whichever method you use should give you approximately the same result.

Put simply, GDP is made up of:

- add bullet points here

#### Comparing GDP internationally

To more fairly compare GDP between nations of different sizes, we express a country's GDP divided by its population, to give a GDP per capita (ie per head).

## What affects economic performance?

Factors that affect GDP are:

### Manufacturing production

### Levels of investment

### The rate of unemployment

## How can we avoid recession?

You can't really.  Economies naturally go through cycles of prosperity and downturn.  Therefore, recession is a fact of life: what goes up must come down.

Various events can trigger damage to the economy, like the current coronavirus crisis or the credit crunch of 2008 which have both led to economic crashes all over the world.

## What is a depression, as opposed to a recession?

- a depression is a recession that lasts ages (cite The Great Depression in the USA and its causes and also mention when the last one in the UK was)

## What does recession mean for you?

- lack of jobs
- not being able to save
- higher prices in the shops

## Should you be worried?

Any time there is bad news about the economy, it's always worrying.
