Lockdown.  Many of us are spending 23 hours a day at home.  We're all looking for ways to break the monotony.  But somehow the pile of unfinished or unstarted projects seems no more appealing than it did six weeks ago...

Back in April, I agreed to help my friend and Ladies Of Code (LoC) co-organiser, Sarah, set up her personal blog site.  By that stage, only a couple of tech communities had taken their events online.  We at LoC were trying to figure out if and how to move to virtual meetups, both in terms of content and tooling.  And then it hit me...

Why not spend a Saturday afternoon doing our coding projects and invite LoC members to join us remotely?  I was convinced that procrastination and lack of motivation were rife, whether or not people admitted it.  I was also of the firm belief that vocalising your goals meant you were more likely to try and achieve them.

And so, **Get On With It!  Bring Your Own Project** was born.  My inspiration for the name came from our other series: **Get Heard** for public speaking upskilling and **Get Into...** for tech roles under the spotlight.

We figured that if nobody else turned up, we'd lost nothing except Â£15 on a Zoom subscription as we were going to work on our own projects anyway.

In my mind, for the sessions to be successful, there were a few essential ingredients:

**1. Careful choice of language.**

I have heard a lot of talk over the past few weeks about how:

* "When you go for a job in the future, employers are going to ask you how you spent lockdown and you need to have a good answer that involves learning and personal development."

* "You have more free time than you've ever had.  You have no excuse not to learn that new skill/finish those projects/get fit..."

Not everyone has more time on their hands now.  Many folks with caring responsibilities are getting zero respite.  Some are having to manage this alongside full-time jobs.  To endeavour not to alienate anyone, I worded the event description carefully.

We were also careful about the language we used during the events, which I elaborate on later.

**2. Optional (but highly encouraged) switching-on of cameras and mics.**

To get the most out of coming together, we need to discuss things.  I believed that most people who were shy or introverted may well feel brave enough to speak up after others had shared.

**3. An opportunity to state your objective(s) for the session.**

Once you've voiced your intentions to the universe, they're out there and you can't take them back!  That's not to say you're committed and need to beat yourself up if you don't achieve them.  But there's something about hearing them in your own voice which cements them.

I was careful not to use the word "accountability" because that implies an element of compulsion.  We didn't want people to feel like they were going to be held to what they said they were going to do.  Especially with coding, where you could easily spend half a day trying to fix one bug.

However, some members were pleased to have what they called "accountability" and that was fine with us.  If it worked for them, we were happy but we weren't going to dictate that.

**4. Breaks.**

Working continuously for too long can be counterproductive so we made sure to build breaks in.

**5. Opportunities to check in and celebrate.**

This goes hand-in-hand with stating your intentions.  The aim of the session is to get things done, so we needed to be able to come together and cheerlead and and pat each other on the back.




If there's stuff you want to get started, finished or make progress on, but are struggling for motivation, join us this Sunday 26 of April.
We'll get together to share what we're doing, cheer each other on and generally support each other to kick-start some momentum.

Examples of things people worked on in previous sessions:

* A new CV
* Blog posts
* A personal website
* An app to help children to be healthy
* Writing up READMEs
* Preparing a talk
* Taking a course about accessibility
* Completing a nano-degree
* Taking a machine learning course
* Raspberry Pi project
* Fix bugs on open source projects
* Learning Python
* Building a complete app for a hackathon
* Research on how to deploy a web app and create a game!


While visiting a taqueria in San Diego, I discovered the breakfast burrito: sausage, ham, cheese, egg and potato all steaming hot inside a tortilla.  As all the components of a full English breakfast are readily available here in the UK, I decided to make my own version of this dish at home.

Here is my recipe.  I didn't skimp on prep time but there are definitely some convenience **shortcuts**, which I have included within the method.

### Preparation and cooking time: 30 minutes

### Ingredients

**Per burrito** (one burrito per person kept us full for hours):

* One **sausage** (or corresponding amount of sausage meat)
* Two rashers of **streaky bacon** (or ham - thick cut is probably best)
* Three **eggs**
* Handful of grated **mild cheddar cheese**
* Medium-sized **potato**, about the size of two eggs
* One soft **tortilla wrap**
* Dash of cooking **oil**

### Method

Preheat your oven to **gas mark 7** / 425f / 220c / 200c (fan).

Peel and wash your **potato**.

Cut it in half across the width, then slice it into short, skinny **chips** (eg 3cm * 0.7cm * 0.7cm).  You don't want them too fat or too long, otherwise they will take a long time to cook and you'll have a lumpy burrito.

Put them in a baking tray / ovenproof dish and add a dash of cooking **oil**.  Make sure all the chips have a thin layer of oil on them.  Season according to your own taste (I like **garlicy chips**).

Cook them for **20 minutes** in the oven.

While they are cooking, skin your **sausages**.  Divide the sausage meat into **small pieces**, about the size of **peanut M&Ms**.  At this point, I removed any obvious big pieces of fat from the sausage meat.  Yes, I know this fat is present when I cook the sausages whole, but when you can see it, it's different...

<!-- ![image](/images/burrito_cooking_sausage.jpg){: .image .right} -->

Cook the sausage pieces over a **medium heat** in a pan.  Don't be tempted to turn the heat up high, as you want the sausage to be cooked all the way through.

***Convenience shortcut:*** Leave the sausages in their skins and cook them under the **grill**, then cut them into small pieces.

Whisk your **eggs**.  No need to add salt, as there is loads in the processed meats and cheese.  **Scramble** the eggs over a **low to medium heat** until they are almost cooked.

Fry the **bacon** rashers in the sausage pan or ***convenience shortcut:*** put them on the grill with the sausages.

Cut the **bacon** rashers into bite-sized pieces.

Wrap the **tortilla** in foil (I laid them out flat) and heat them in the oven per the instructions on the packet (mine said eight minutes).  ***Convenience shortcut:*** you can heat them for eight seconds in the microwave instead (don't use foil with this method).

Grate the **cheese**.

A minute or two before the **chips** are cooked and the **tortilla** are warmed, add the **sausages**, **bacon** and **cheese** to the **eggs** in the pan and turn the heat back on.  Finish scrambling the **eggs**.  The **cheese** should melt by the time the eggs are cooked.

Remove the **chips** and **tortilla** from the oven.  Blot excess **oil** from the **chips** if necessary.

Transfer the **egg mixture** from the pan to the **tortilla**.

Add the **chips** to the mixture, distributing evenly.

Tuck both ends of the **tortilla** in and roll your **burrito**.

**Enjoy!**

### What I'll do differently next time

* I didn't get much of a stretch on the **cheese**, and I love **stretchy cheese**, so next time instead of adding it to the pan, I will spread a layer of it over the **tortilla** so it encases the mixture and is not cooked into it.

* I will probably heat the **tortilla** in the microwave because it's much quicker and will therefore help me manage my time better.
