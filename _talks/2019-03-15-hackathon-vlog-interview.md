I've attended a few hackathons in the past five years; [I won the first one](https://blog.makersacademy.com/international-womens-day-hackathon-makeithappen-923aba741e58).

In this interview I talk about my journey from coding as a child to becoming a software engineer as an adult.  I also talk about why anyone can succeed at a hackathon.

This vlog interview turned out to be a precursor to my talk "Hackathons For The Uninitiated", which I have given in London, UK and California, USA.

You can watch the interview below.
