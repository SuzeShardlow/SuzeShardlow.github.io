I am a Chapter Lead at Ladies Of Code London.  When COVID-19 reached the UK and forced us 100% online, I looked at ways to innovate our offerings.  This led to me devising an interview format for our Get Into... series.

Get Into... is where we demystify roles in the tech industry.  LoC events cater for those who are already in tech and want to level up and/or switch tracks as well as those who are new to the industry. People are always keen to hear from those who have gone before them.

I chose an interview format to make it more interesting for online viewers and reduce the lead time by removing the labour from the interviewee: all they have to do is turn up on the night.  You can read about my methodology in my [blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-06-05-get-into-web-development.md %}) .

I source the interviewees, write all my own questions and include two speed rounds to vary the pace and keep viewers engaged.

The interviews are conducted on Zoom in front of a live audience who can send their questions in via the chat function.  I select some of these questions to weave into the interview.

For Get Into... Engineering Management, I approached Software Engineering Manager at Gousto, Amy Phillips, because she has held a number of tech management roles across various organisations and was well-placed to give us some views about what it takes to be an engineering manager.

Topics we covered included:

* Different flavours of engineering management
* Who your main working relationships are with as an engineering manager
* Where you can go from engineering management if you want to progress further
* Whether or not Marmite should be allowed in the house...

We record the interviews and post them on YouTube after the event.  You can watch Get Into... Engineering Management below:
