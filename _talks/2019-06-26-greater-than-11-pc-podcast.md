I did my first tech talk as a software engineer back in April 2019, about how I switched careers.  Renée Vaughan Sutherland, Chief Creative Officer at a TV company, saw the video and contacted me to ask if I would guest on her podcast!

She was interviewing women in creative roles and counted coding as one of them. I accepted the invitation straightaway and, a few weeks later, went to record the podcast with her.

We talk coding, crafting and creativity: what I love about them and how they’re all linked.
