codebar monthlies are for developers with 0-6 months' coding experience.

Hackathons are for everyone in tech.  They a great way to meet others in the industry and hone your collaboration skills.

In this talk, I describe:

* What a hackathon is
* Different hackathon formats
* What it's like to take part
* How to find others to work with
* What non-coding skills you can bring
* How I entered and won my first hackathon
* How you can find hackathons to enter

A straw poll at this talk showed that a fifth of the audience knew what a hackathon was and didn't think it was for them, however, by the end of my talk they were all keen to try one.
