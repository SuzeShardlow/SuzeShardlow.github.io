I am a Chapter Lead at Ladies Of Code London.  When COVID-19 reached the UK and forced us 100% online, I looked at ways to innovate our offerings.  This led to me devising an interview format for our Get Into... series.

Get Into... is where we demystify roles in the tech industry.  LoC events cater for those who are already in tech and want to level up and/or switch tracks as well as those who are new to the industry. People are always keen to hear from those who have gone before them.

I chose an interview format to make it more interesting for online viewers and reduce the lead time by removing the labour from the interviewee: all they have to do is turn up on the night.  You can read about my methodology in my [blog post](/blog/2020/06/05/get-into-web-development) .

I source the interviewees, write all my own questions and include two speed rounds to vary the pace and keep viewers engaged.

The interviews are conducted on Zoom in front of a live audience who can send their questions in via the chat function.  I select some of these questions to weave into the interview.

For Get Into... Web Development, I approached Niamh because she had an unusual story: she taught herself.  I wanted to highlight this as a viable route to paid coding work which may be an option for those who can't access bootcamps or similar courses.

Topics we covered included:

* How Niamh taught herself to code alongside a full-time job
* Moving from learning to code to getting paid to code
* Workplace mentoring and support
* Which were better: Boyzone or Westlife...

We record the interviews and post them on YouTube after the event.  You can watch Get Into... Web Development below:
