Fundamental JS is part of the San Diego JS family of meetups.  It is a monthly event which focuses on "vanilla" JavaScript: no frameworks or libraries allowed!  Each month they have one code talk and one people skills talk.

This is a repeat of the talk I gave at codebar monthlies in October 2019, with updated slides and the content customised for an American audience.

Hackathons are for everyone in tech.  They a great way to meet others in the industry and hone your collaboration skills.

In this talk, I describe:

* What a hackathon is
* Different hackathon formats
* What it's like to take part
* How to find others to work with
* What non-coding skills you can bring
* How I entered and won my first hackathon
* How you can find hackathons to enter

Interestingly, the straw poll I took at this talk gave similar results to the one in London.  It showed that a fifth of the audience knew what a hackathon was and didn't think it was for them, however, by the end of my talk they were all keen to try one.
