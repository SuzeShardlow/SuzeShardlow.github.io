I am a Director of Women Who Code (WWCode) London and, as soon as I knew I would be holidaying in San Diego, I reached out to my WWCode counterparts there to offer to run a workshop for them.

January is a popular time to try new things and make changes in one's life and career, so I decided to create a workshop to teach people how to create their own personal branding and portfolio website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

This hands-on workshop is aimed at experienced coders (of any language) who are familiar with common programming concepts like variables, objects, loops and IF statements.  It is not suitable for code newbies.

I equip participants with prepared website templates and the skills to add layouts and content to their site using DRY principles.  They can add as many blog posts and projects as they like, which will be neatly rendered in a grid on a flexible template.

I also created a student handbook which they are free to use and refer to in their own time.  Some students have shared this with friends and colleagues.

As you can see from the photo, I had a full house of 40 students for this workshop.  Three of the participants reached out to me within 48 hours of the session to let me know they had published blog posts on their new sites.

Testimonials:

"Suze led the "Building Your Portfolio with Jekyll" workshop offered through Women Who Code in San Diego, California. I was really excited for the opportunity to listen and learn anything code related from someone from another country, and Suze is from the UK. The entire process was really rewarding. The event was communicated well in advance, and after I signed up, Suze reached out same day via email to add me to the group's Slack channel. She sent us prerequisites for what we should already know and notes ahead of her presentation. The actual presentation was well organized, quick paced (under 2 hours), with pauses to explain syntax using Jekyll, and included recommendations on how to utilize Jekyll to promote dry code. As a growing developer, I was excited to take part in a workshop where we built a new project from start to finish and had the site live and up and running by the end. I definitely hope to see Suze for another workshop! Thank you!"

"Suze hosted a really practical and well structured workshop for Women Who Code San Diego focused on teaching how to create a personal dev blog from GitHub. Even if attendees had different background and experience, they were all able to easily follow the workshop and have a live blog at the end of the event. Suze is an exceptional teacher, engaged on helping everyone succeed before, during, and after the workshop. I hope she can host th workshop for us again given the large interest received."

"Suze Shardlow is an amazing instructor. Her passion for technology and experience as a Full Stack Engineer is invaluable in her role as Director of Women Who Code London. Suze created and led an awesome workshop on how to Build Your Personal Website And Blog With GitHub Pages and Jekyll. I was fortunate to attend her workshop during her travels to the US, at a recent local WWCode chapter meetup. She skillfully curated the content and supplemental materials in such a way that allowed for maximum comprehension and successful results within a limited hour long time frame. The technical skills I obtained from the workshop facilitated by Suze were easily applied to a subsequent project, and the materials provided have been a great resource in the planning of my own personal professional blog."
