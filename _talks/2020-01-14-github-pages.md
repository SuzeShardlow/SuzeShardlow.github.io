I am a Director of Women Who Code (WWCode) London and, as soon as I knew I would be holidaying in San Diego, I reached out to my WWCode counterparts there to offer to run a workshop for them.

January is a popular time to try new things and make changes in one's life and career, so I decided to design a workshop to teach people how to create their own personal branding and portfolio website using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

This hands-on workshop is aimed at experienced coders (of any language) who are familiar with common programming concepts like variables, objects, loops and IF statements.  It is not suitable for code newbies.

I equipped participants with prepared website templates and the skills to add layouts and content to their site using DRY principles.  They can add as many blog posts and projects as they like, which will be neatly rendered in a grid on a flexible template.

I had a full house of 40 students for this workshop.  Three of the participants reached out to me within 48 hours of the session to let me know they had published blog posts on their new sites.
