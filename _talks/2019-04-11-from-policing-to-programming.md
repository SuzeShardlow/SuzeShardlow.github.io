This was my first tech talk, which has had over 6400 views on YouTube.  You can watch it via the link on the right hand side.

I first started coding when I was seven years old.  I became a software engineer as an adult following long careers in marketing and policing and surviving three redundancies.

Here I talk about:

* How I decided I wanted to be a coder
* How I made the leap
* What I learned along the way
