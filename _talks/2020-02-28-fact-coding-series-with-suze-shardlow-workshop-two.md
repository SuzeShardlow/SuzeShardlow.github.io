Following the talk I gave at their Symposium in November 2019, the lecturers at the University of Sussex invited me to create and deliver a series of three half-day coding workshops for them.

The workshop participants are Professors, PhDs and PhD candidates who have no coding experience, or are very rusty.

The brief was to:

* Teach the basics of JavaScript and Python
* Guide participants through using those languages in a practical way to create something interactive and relevant to the participants' work

After bouncing some ideas off the client, I suggested we build a chatbot as the end product of the workshop series.  The client has some data gathered during a project 30+ years ago which we are making accessible via the chatbot.

**All the workshops are hands-on.**

**Workshop One** (in early February 2020) focuses on the basics of JavaScript and Python.

**Workshop Two** (this one) focuses on building the bot in stages, gradually introducing intelligence

**Workshop Three** (in March 2020) concludes the build of the chatbot, increases the AI and brings in the original data from 1988 so we can chat with the subjects of the study.

Professor Rachel Thomson of the University of Sussex, who conducted the original research, has written a [blog post](http://reanimatingdata.co.uk/uncategorized/a-feminist-chat-bot/) about Workshop One.
