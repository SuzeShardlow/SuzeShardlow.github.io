    <h1 id="about-page">About page</h1>

<p>I love making things that people use and enjoy.</p>

<p>I have moved into software development and am now looking for a full stack role in a fun, supportive team where I can make a real contribution and learn new skills.</p>

<p>I have a lifelong interest in coding and spent many happy hours in my childhood programming my BBC Micro, using BASIC. I designed and wrote a computer game which earned me the school prize for IT.</p>

<p>At university I taught myself HTML and CSS and built websites for my friends.</p>

<p>More recently, I participated in my first hackathon… and won it.</p>

<p>Throughout my career so far, I’ve consistently been drawn to the problem-solving, strategic and technical aspects of my work. I enjoy using new tech but I’ve always been more interested in how things are made. I’ve realised that coding is my true calling.</p>

<p>In my spare time I love to sew, bake and sing.</p>

<p>The photo is of me standing underneath 100ft of bunting I sewed for my best friend’s wedding.</p>
