I'm a community manager, coder, crafter and choir singer.  At the moment I'm also trying to get my 5km time under 24 minutes...

I have a lifelong interest in coding and spent many happy hours in my childhood programming my BBC Micro, using BASIC. I designed and wrote a computer game which earned me the school prize for IT.

Around the same time, I was busy learning how to use a sewing machine, making pencil cases, tops, skirts and trousers for myself.  It's cool when people ask where I bought stuff and I can respond "I made it"!

At university I taught myself HTML and CSS and built websites for my friends.

I enjoy using new tech but I've always been more interested in how things are made. I've realised that coding and crafting are my true callings.

I also love to bake and sing.  Here's one of my favourite karaoke songs:

I'm an active volunteer and currently hold leadership roles at [Ladies Of Code London](https://www.ladiesofcode.com) and [The Scout Association](https://www.scouts.org.uk).

The photo is of me standing underneath 100ft of bunting I sewed for my best friend's wedding.
