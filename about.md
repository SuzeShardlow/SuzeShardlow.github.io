I have moved into software development and am now looking for a full stack role in a fun, supportive team where I can make a real contribution and learn new skills.

I have a lifelong interest in coding and spent many happy hours in my childhood programming my BBC Micro, using BASIC. I designed and wrote a computer game which earned me the school prize for IT.

At university I taught myself HTML and CSS and built websites for my friends.

More recently, I participated in my first hackathon... and won it.

Throughout my career so far, Iâ€™ve consistently been drawn to the problem-solving, strategic and technical aspects of my work. I enjoy using new tech but I've always been more interested in how things are made. I've realised that coding is my true calling.

In my spare time I love to sew, bake and sing.

The photo is of me standing underneath 100ft of bunting I sewed for my best friend's wedding.
