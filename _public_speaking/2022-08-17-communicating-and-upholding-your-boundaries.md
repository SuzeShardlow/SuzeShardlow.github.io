"No" is a complete sentence and it's often a difficult word to say.  As a result, we end up with situations, environments, tasks and treatment we don't want.  Setting boundaries helps us to understand and establish our limits.  They are essential for our health, but they are useless if we don't enforce them.  And it's harder to enforce them if we haven't communicated them.

In this talk, I cover:

- how to let someone know they have crossed the line
- how to tell them it won't be happening again
- how to decide in advance how you will uphold your boundary if they cross it
