I was approached to take part in this GitHub Education Twitch show.  For each episode, they have a tech professional (on this occasion, me) and a student who is taking a non-computer science degree.

We started off with two games of Hangman: one to reveal my profession and the other to reveal the student's degree title.

Then we had a chat about what our job/degree involves and our career journey so far.

Finally, we played a game where we had to give one-word clues so the others could guess our secret passwords.

It was a lot of fun and the audience was ace!  My first time on Twitch.
