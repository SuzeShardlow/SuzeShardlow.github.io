I am the Developer Community Manager at Redis.  In 2021, I organised the company's first-ever Hacktoberfest project.

As part of this, I held a series of fireside chats with members of our documentation team to demystify technical writing.  I decided to do this because documentation is often cited as a great way to get started with open source, but many people don't know what it involves, so they don't try it.

Kaitlyn is one of our technical writers.  In this fireside chat we discussed how she got into technical writing from a non-technical academic background.
