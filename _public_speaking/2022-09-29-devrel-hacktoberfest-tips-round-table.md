I was invited to speak at DevRelCon Deep Dives, which was an online event for DevRel leaders featuring speakers with deep expertise in their field.

My session was a round table entitled "Developer Marketing In Practice" where I discussed the following questions with Christie Fidura, Mahmoud Abdelwahab, Matthew Revell and Ram√≥n Huidobro:

- What is the difference between DevRel and developer marketing?
- What do developer marketing people do?
- How can you make developer marketing a part of your developer relations strategy?
