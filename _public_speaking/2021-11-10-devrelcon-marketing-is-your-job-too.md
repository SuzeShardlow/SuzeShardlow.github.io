I was selected to speak at DevRelCon 2021!  I gave a [20-minute talk](https://2021.devrel.net/speaker/suze-shardlow/) which covered the main tenets of marketing and how we can use them to be more effective developer relations practitioners.

I was also invited to speak on a panel about how to go further with your developer marketing, with Tamao Nakahara, Zachary Powell and Cory Althoff.

My talk covered:

* What marketing is
* What marketing is not (it isn't just about advertising and publicity)
* The AIDA (attention/awareness, interest, desire, action) marketing model
* The 7 Ps of marketing (product, price, place, promotion, people, process, physical evidence)
* Practical, actionable ways in which devrel professionals can combine AIDA with the marketing 7 Ps to engage with developers in a meaningful way without selling or marketing to them
