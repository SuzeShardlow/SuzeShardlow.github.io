codebar approached me to give a talk aimed at early-career developers to encourage them to get into tech public speaking.  I agreed, and created a brand new talk because I didn't have one on the shelf.

In tech, we hear a lot about how getting into public speaking can boost your dev career.  But, for most people, the mere thought fills them with terror.  They see a call for proposals (CFP) and believe they have nothing to contribute.  In this talk, I addressed a number of the common limiting beliefs held by developers at all levels of experience and showed the audience how to take those first steps.
