TECH(K)NOW Day is a twice-yearly women in tech conference, held around International Women's Day (March) and Ada Lovelace Day (October).

When the UK first went into COVID lockdown in March 2020, I took all my community events online.  One of the events we introduced was a weekly co-working session called Get On With It.  I have written about my Get On With It methodology in my [blog](/blog/get-on-with-it).

This talk discusses:

- How to allocate time to projects you need to get done
- The benefits of co-working
- How to use co-working as a productivity tool
- How to set up and run your own co-working sessions using my framework which has since been adopted in the USA
