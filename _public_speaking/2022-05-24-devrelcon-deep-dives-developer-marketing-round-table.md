I was invited to speak at DevRelCon Deep Dives, which was an online event for DevRel leaders featuring speakers with deep expertise in their field.





I was also invited to speak on a panel about how to go further with your developer marketing, with Tamao Nakahara, Zachary Powell and Cory Althoff.

My talk covered:

* What marketing is
* What marketing is not (it isn't just about advertising and publicity)
* The AIDA (attention/awareness, interest, desire, action) marketing model
* The 7 Ps of marketing (product, price, place, promotion, people, process, physical evidence)
* Practical, actionable ways in which devrel professionals can combine AIDA with the marketing 7 Ps to engage with developers in a meaningful way without selling or marketing to them
