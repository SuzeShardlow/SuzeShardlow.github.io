codebar Festival was a three-day online conference.  The organisers approached me to moderate an hour-long live panel discussion on How To Your First Developer Job.

As moderator, I:

* Researched the five panellists' career history.
* Prepared appropriate questions, based on my industry knowledge and research, to find out their experiences of getting their first developer job.
* Ensured each panellist had an equal amount of airtime.
* Fielded questions from the live audience and wove them into the discussion.
* Ensured the session started and finished on time.

You can watch the panel discussion below:
