codebar Festival is an annual, three-day, online conference which began in 2021.  For the second year running, the organisers approached me to moderate an hour-long live panel discussion on How To Land Your First Developer Job.

As moderator, I:

* Researched the four panellists' career history.
* Prepared appropriate questions, based on my industry knowledge and research, to find out their experiences of getting their first developer job.
* Ensured each panellist had an equal amount of airtime.
* Fielded questions from the live audience and wove them into the discussion.
* Ensured the session started and finished on time.

The recording of this session is coming soon.
