I was invited by the University of Sussex to speak on the subject of inclusion in tech communities at their coding conference.

The audience was Professors, PhDs and PhD candidates from the University of Sussex and other institutions in the [CHASE Network](https://www.chase.ac.uk/aboutchase).

In this long talk, I cover:

* Communities in tech and why we need them
* Privilege: does inclusion mean exclusion?
* "Safe" and "brave" spaces
* Language: why things like "hi guys!" aren't unisex

When you enter the tech industry, you soon realise that meetups are a Thing.  Groups gather every night of the week in every major city in the world and share IT ideas and knowledge over pizza and beers.

Statistics, by their very nature, vary - but, by any measure, tech is dominated by white men and has been for decades.  There are, however, thousands of women, people of colour and other minorities in the industry.  And there are countless community groups catering to their needs.

But by being inclusive, are these groups actually exclusive?  Have you ever seen an event advertised and thought it looked great but then realised that you’re not the target market for the group? How did this make you feel?  Happy that the marginalised community in question had a safe space, or slighted and wondering how they’d like it if you had a club just for people like you?

Would you agree that, mostly, people just want to be themselves?  Have you ever experienced a time where you felt you couldn’t?

You can listen to the audio recording of this talk below.  The recording starts with an introduction by Professor Kate O'Riordan, Head of School for Media, Film and Music at the University of Sussex and my talk begins at four minutes in.
