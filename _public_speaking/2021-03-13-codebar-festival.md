The Global Diversity CFP Day (GDCFP Day) team approached me to ask if I would be Europe Lead for their first online event.

GDCFP Day takes place at the beginning of every year.  It usually takes the form of in-person workshops in 80+ cities worldwide (see my [blog post](/blog/so-you-want-to-speak-at-a-tech-conference/)), however, for COVID reasons that was not possible this year.

Instead, GDCFP Day consisted of six live streams from different continents across the world, which all took place from 9am local time on Saturday 20th February.

The European stream was six hours long.

As Europe Lead, I:

- Curated content suitable for aspiring tech conference speakers.
- Sourced fellow Europe-based experienced conference speakers to deliver the content.
- Designed the schedule for the six-hour event.
- MCd the entire event, ensuring it kept to the schedule.
- Facilitated one 1:1 fireside chat and two fireside panel discussions.

The video will be available soon.
