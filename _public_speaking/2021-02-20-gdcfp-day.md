I am a Chapter Lead at Ladies Of Code London.  When COVID-19 reached the UK and forced us 100% online, we had to look at our plans and decide whether to mothball them or convert them to something we could deliver over Zoom.

Get Heard was a four-week public speaking workshop series we ran in July 2020.  It culminated in a short talks showcase evening for the four "graduates".  You can read about our methodology in my [blog post](/blog/2020/how-to-create-a-tech-talk-in-four-weeks).

I MCd the event, using my own script.

You can watch the Get Heard short talks showcase event below:
