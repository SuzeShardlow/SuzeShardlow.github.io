codebar monthlies are for developers with 0-6 months' coding experience.

After my talk on Hackathons For The Uninitiated in October 2019, codebar asked me to return in Q1 2020 to deliver a talk based on my blog post on [Tech Conferences For The Uninitiated](/blog/2019/09/29/tech-conferences-for-the-uninitiated/).

In April 2019 I attended my first tech conference as a software engineer and, by the end of the year, had attended more than 15 conferences and spoken at two of them.

In this talk, I advise on:

* Deciding why to attend
* Finding your tribe
* Finding your level
* Getting your ticket
* Connecting with people beforehand
* Figuring out your schedule
* Deciding what to bring
* Finding your space
* Managing your expectations
* Networking: approaching people you don't know
* Networking: keeping in touch
