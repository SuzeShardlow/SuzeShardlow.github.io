I am a resident expert at Event Handler, a Discord community for developer event organisers.

Kevin Lewis, the founder, asked me to join him for a fireside chat about Calls For Proposals.

We covered:

* What CFPs are
* When to run a CFP
* How to run a CFP and how to choose talks
* CFP platforms
* Understanding speaker motivations
* How to communicated the results
