For most people, “we’re letting you go” are the words you never want to hear.  Being made redundant, or laid off, can be shocking and devastating.  I have faced redundancy three times in my career.  It became easier each time because I learnt something new about the process, and knowledge is power.

In this talk, I outline the things you need to know and do before, during and after your job is taken away from you so you can protect your emotional and financial well-being.
