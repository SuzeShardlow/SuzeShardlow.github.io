I was the Developer Community Manager at Redis.  In 2021, I organised the company's first-ever Hacktoberfest project.

As part of this, I held a series of fireside chats with members of our documentation team to demystify technical writing.  I decided to do this because documentation is often cited as a great way to get started with open source, but many people don't know what it involves, so they don't try it.

I organised the firesides, structured the conversations, wrote the questions and acted as host, interviewer and MC for the events.

Kaitlyn, Rachel and Lance are technical writers in the documentation team.  In this fireside chat we discussed how they got into technical writing from technical and non-technical backgrounds.
