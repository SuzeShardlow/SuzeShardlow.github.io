Nothing says you’re an expert like being booked to speak at a conference.  But how do you get invited if you have no idea what the selection committee is looking for - or, worse still, you can’t even decide on a topic?

Maybe you’re all ready to submit your talk proposal, but the thought of actually getting up there and delivering your presentation fills you with a strange mixture of excitement and terror...

I fell into the former camp.  As a former senior manager at the Met Police and Chapter Lead at Ladies Of Code: London, I am no stranger to organising and speaking at large events.  However, since pivoting my career and recently becoming a software engineer, I’ve found it hard to believe that there was a tech topic in the world that anyone would want to hear me talk about.  I came to the workshop with vague ideas that I could talk about how I switched careers but this just didn’t seem technical enough for me.
