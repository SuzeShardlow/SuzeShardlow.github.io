Today I learned about...

### Toy stuffing 

#### What:

* It's sold by weight.

* As it's so light, it's hard to judge how much you will need when you're browsing online.

* 500g doesn't look like much in the bag but it goes a long way.

#### How:

I made a stuffed animal and needed to buy filling for it.
