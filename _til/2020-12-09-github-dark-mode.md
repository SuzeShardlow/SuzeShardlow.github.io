Today I learned about...

### GitHub dark mode 

#### What:

* Doggerland was the piece of land which joined Britain to mainland Europe.  It was obliterated 8000 years ago by a series of tsunamis.  Scientists have found parts of Doggerland off the Norfolk coast which may contain archaeological clues about the Neolithic people who settled there thousands of years later.

#### How:

I came across [an article in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/01/evidence-life-on-doggerland-after-devastating-tsunamis-study) which cites [a Cambridge University Press article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquity/article/great-wave-the-storegga-tsunami-and-the-end-of-doggerland/CB2E132445086D868BF508041CC1B827).
