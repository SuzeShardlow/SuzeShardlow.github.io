#### What:

* Cee Lo Green sang this song.  He was half of Gnarls Barkley.

* The song was the first ever to become UK number one purely on the strength of download sales.

#### How:

I was watching [The Noughties](https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000pypw/the-noughties-series-1-7-2006) on BBC2.
