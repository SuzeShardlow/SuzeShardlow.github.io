Today I learned about...

### Studio 54 

#### What:

* The 1970s NYC nightclub didn't have an alcohol licence at first, so they obtained daily licences using a catering business, the Broadway Catering Corp, as a front.

#### How:

I was watching [*Studio 54: The Documentary*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5773986/).
