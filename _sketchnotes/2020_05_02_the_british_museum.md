This is a sketchnote of a virtual tour around parts of the British Museum.  It depicts some facts about, and history of, the museum, along with exhibits including:

- a parody by [Kitagawa Utamaro](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/A_1906-1220-0-364-1-3)
- an [African mud cloth](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/E_Af1956-27-10)
- a [fake cave painting by Banksy](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4563751.stm)
- digital exhibits like [10000-year-old African rock art](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/E_2013-2034-3106)
- the [Rosetta Stone](https://blog.britishmuseum.org/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-the-rosetta-stone/)


I did the sketching in real time (colouring in afterwards) and the tour was super fast which is why this is a bit messy.
