This is a sketchnote of a talk by [Sagar Patil](https://twitter.com/imbecileiloquy), where he taught us about a few useful concepts we might not know if we don't have a computer science degree.

It was one of my first sketchnotes so I didn't do it in real time: I took written notes at the talk and drew up the sketchnote afterwards.
