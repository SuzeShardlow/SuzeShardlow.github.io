## Icebreaker was the final project I built on the 12-week coding bootcamp I attended.

I wrote it in seven days, using AngularJS on Rails and internal and external APIs.

This full stack app is for techies who know they have to attend networking events but are too scared to go on their own.</p>

The app pulls event data from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api" target="_blank">Meetup.com API</a>, from which the user can select an event.  The details from the Meetup.com API are then populated into the internal API as a pre-meet.  Other users can then join that pre-meet so that they know at least one person at the main event.


## Unscramble! is a JavaScript game I built after two weeks of coding tuition.

I wrote it in seven days using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

              <li><a href="http://suzeshardlow.com/unscramble" target="_blank" class="button">Play game</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/unscramble" target="_blank" class="button">View code</a></li>
            </ul>

It is based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle" target="_blank">popular toy</a> from my childhood where the player must slide number tiles around a 4x4 grid until they are in numerical order.

We were given a free choice of projects and I wanted to do this one because it was heavy on logic and therefore presented me with a number of challenges.


## Skedaddle is a MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) stack app I built which draws data from the <a href="https://api.tfl.gov.uk" target="_blank">TfL API</a> to help Tube travellers.</h2>

I created this app in seven days, during my 12-week coding bootcamp.


            <ul class="actions">
              <li><a href="http://suzeshardlow.com/skedaddle" target="_blank" class="button">Launch app</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/skedaddle" target="_blank" class="button">View code</a></li>
            </ul>

The TfL API has thousands of endpoints and I wanted to see if I could build an app which allows users to log in securely, plan journeys and save them to the database, as well as view station information.

I am now creating an <a href="https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/alexa_skill_skedaddle" target="_blank">Alexa skill</a> which also uses the TfL API.

I am especially pleased with the real-time arrivals boards I created, which display the same data you would see if you were on the Tube network looking at a platform indicator.

I used <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a> and <a href="https://balsamiq.com/" target="_blank">Balsamiq</a> to plan.


## Borro is a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, Node.js) stack app which allows users to lend and borrow household items.

I worked with two classmates and we divided up tasks to create this app within seven days, towards the end of our coding bootcamp.

            <ul class="actions">
              <li><a href="http://suzeshardlow.com/borro" target="_blank" class="button">Launch app</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/borro" target="_blank" class="button">View code</a></li>
            </ul>

My role within this app was to act as Git master (merging contributed code into the app), create the three RESTful resources (Users, Items and Requests) and set up the user authentication and Angular controllers.
