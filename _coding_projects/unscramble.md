## Unscramble! is a JavaScript game I built after two weeks of learning JavaScript.

I wrote it in seven days using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It is based on a [popular toy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) from my childhood where the player must slide number tiles around a 4x4 grid until they are in numerical order.

We were given a free choice of projects and I wanted to do this one because it was heavy on logic and therefore presented me with a number of challenges.
