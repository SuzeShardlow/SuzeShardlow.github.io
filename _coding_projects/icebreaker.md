## Icebreaker was the final project I built on the 12-week coding bootcamp I attended.

I wrote it in seven days, using AngularJS on Rails and internal and external APIs.

This full stack app is for techies who know they have to attend networking events but are too scared to go on their own.</p>

The app pulls event data from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api">Meetup.com API</a>, from which the user can select an event.  The details from the Meetup.com API are then populated into the internal API as a pre-meet.  Other users can then join that pre-meet so that they know at least one person at the main event.
