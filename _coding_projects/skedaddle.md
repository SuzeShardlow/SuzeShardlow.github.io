## Skedaddle is a MEN (MongoDB, Express, Node.js) stack app I built in seven days which draws data from the [Transport for London (TfL) API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk) to help Tube travellers.

The TfL API has thousands of endpoints and I wanted to see if I could build an app which allows users to log in securely, plan journeys and save them to the database, as well as view station information.

I am now creating an [Alexa skill](https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/alexa_skill_skedaddle) which also uses the TfL API.

I am especially pleased with the real-time arrivals boards I created, which display the same data you would see if you were on the Tube network looking at a platform indicator.

I used [Trello](https://trello.com) and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) to plan.
