<!-- <a href="http://suzeshardlow.com/skedaddle">Launch app</a> -->

The [Transport for London (TfL) API](https://api.tfl.gov.uk) has thousands of endpoints and I wanted to see if I could build an app which allows users to log in securely, plan journeys and save them to the database, as well as view station information.

[View code](https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/skedaddle)

I am now creating an [Alexa skill](https://github.com/SuzeShardlow/alexa_skill_skedaddle) which also uses the TfL API.

I am especially pleased with the real-time arrivals boards I created, which display the same data you would see if you were on the Tube network looking at a platform indicator.

I used [Trello](https://trello.com) and [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) to plan.
