I am an **experienced public speaker** and have given talks at meetups in **London, UK** and **California, USA**.  I have also **spoken at tech conferences** in the **UK** and **Berlin, Germany**.

I am able to create, deliver and amend my talks to suit **different formats**, for example **lightning talks** (5-10 minutes) and **long talks** (25-35 minutes).

I am currently **designing and delivering coding workshops**.  Again, I am able to work in **different formats**, including **75-minute after-work sessions** and **half-day classes**.  All the classes I teach are **hands-on**.

The **workshops** I have delivered are all **bespoke for each client** and the participants have ranged from **code newbie**, to **lapsed coder**, to **experienced developer**.

My talks and workshops are listed below.  Where available, I have **linked to video or audio recordings**.
